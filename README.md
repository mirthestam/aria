# Aria

A remote control app for MPD and MPD-based players like Volumio that lets you browse and explore their music libraries, with dedicated support for classical music.

## Building

1. Glone this repo recursive with `git clone --recurse-submodules`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory

I recommend to install this app using Flatpak.

To Install using Flatpak:
1. Run `prebuild.sh`
2. Run `bundle.sh` to create a flatpak bundle
3. Run `flatpak install ./flatpak/aria.flatpak` to install the app.

To Run without Flatpak:
1. Run `prebuild.sh` (this does require Flatpak to be installed to be able to run pre-build tasks)
2. Run `build.sh` to build the app to `./dist`
3. Run `./dist/nl.mirthestam.aria` to run the app.
