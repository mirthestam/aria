# Welcome to Aria

Aria is not a Music Player. Aria is a remote for Music Players. Therefore, you'll need to have a compatible Music Player for Aria to work with.

At the moment, Aria supports the [MPD (Music Player Daemon)](docs/mpd.md) Player. 

The reality is that the navigability and presentation of your music library depend on the quality of the available
metadata (tags). There are some [instructions](docs/tagging.md) for how to tag your music properly for Aria to work with.
